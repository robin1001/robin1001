**Hi everyone, This is Binbin Zhang, nice to meet you.**

- ðŸ”­ I'm a believer of open source. I'm the creator of [WeNet Community](https://wenet.org.cn/) which is an open source community. Here are the open source projects and courses that I created:
  - [WeNet](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet), a popular, production first and production ready end-to-end speech recognition toolkit.
  - [WenetSpeech](http://wenet.org.cn/WenetSpeech/), a 10000+ hours open source multi-domain chinese corpus for speech recognition.
  - [WeNet in Action](https://edu.speechhome.com/p/t_pc/goods_pc_detail/goods_detail/course_27jU7hlWuYqO7ymQ6zYO2yIPEHC?app_id=appzxw56sw27444), an open course on end-to-end speech recognition based on WeNet(co-creator).
  - [Automatic Speech Recognition](https://www.shenlanxueyuan.com/course/245), an open course on classic speech recognition(co-creator).
- ðŸŒ± My interests include speech, deep learning frameworks and compilers, and computer architecture.
